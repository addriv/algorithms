# Day 3: Intro to Conditional Statements

## Objective 

In this challenge, we're getting started with conditional statements. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

## Task 

Given an integer, **_n_**, perform the following conditional actions:

* If **_n_** is odd, print Weird
* If **_n_** is even and in the inclusive range of **_2_** to **_5_**, print Not Weird
* If **_n_** is even and in the inclusive range of **_6_** to **_20_**, print Weird
* If **_n_** is even and greater than **_20_**, print Not Weird
* Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not **_n_** is weird.

## Input Format

A single line containing a positive integer, _**n**_.

## Constraints

* 1<= n <= 100

## Output Format

Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not Weird.

## Sample Input 0

3

## Sample Output 0

Weird

## Sample Input 1

24

## Sample Output 1

Not Weird

## Explanation

## Sample Case 0: n = 3  
**_n_** is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print Weird.

## Sample Case 1: n = 24
**_n_** > 20 and **_n_** is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print Not Weird.
